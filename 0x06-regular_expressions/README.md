# Regular expression

A regular expression (regex) is a text pattern that can be used for searching and replacing. Regular expressions are similar to Unix wild cards used in globbing, but much more powerful, and can be used to search, replace and validate text.

Regular expressions are used in many Unix commands such as find and grep, and also within most programming languages such as R and Python.

# Background Context
For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.
