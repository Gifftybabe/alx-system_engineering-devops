# Networking basics #1
**IP Addresses: 
In order to send and direct data across a network, computers need to be able to identify destinations and origins. This identification is an IP—Internet Protocol—address. An IP address is just a set of four numbers between 1 and 254, separated by dots. An example of an IP address is 173.194.43.7.

**Localhost is the hostname or the computer that is currently in use to run a program, in which the computer has the role as a virtual server. In web development, you can develop a server by editing the code in the localhost and exporting your data to the server.

**Netcat (or nc) is a command-line utility that reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP or UDP protocols. It is one of the most powerful tools in the network and system administrators arsenal, and it as considered as a Swiss army knife of networking tools.

**A hosts file is a local file stored on the computer that translates domain names or NetBIOS names into an IP addresses.

When looking up an IP address, the computer first looks at the hosts file to resolve the name. If the name is not in the local hosts file, it tries resolving using a DNS (Domain Name Service), and if also not found, the look up fails.


# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
- What is localhost/127.0.0.1
- What is 0.0.0.0
- What is /etc/hosts
- How to display your machine’s active network interfaces
