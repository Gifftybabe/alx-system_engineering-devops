## 0x0F. Load balancer

Load balancers increase the fault tolerance of your systems by automatically detecting server problems and redirecting client traffic to available servers. You can use load balancing to make these tasks easier: Run application server maintenance or upgrades without application downtime.

A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.

The following are few examples of software load balancers: HAProxy – A TCP load balancer. NGINX – A http load balancer with SSL termination support. (install Nginx on Linux)

# Load balancing performs these critical tasks

- Manages traffic spikes and prevents spikes on a single server.
- Minimizes user request response time.
- Ensures performance and reliability of computing resources, both physical and virtual.
- Adds redundancy and resilience to computing environments.
