# Networking basics #0
** Open system: 
A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 

** Closed system: 
A system which is not connected to the network and canâ€™t be communicated with. 

** Computer Network: 
An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges.
