# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General 
- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
- How to use while, until and for loops
- How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
- How to use the cut command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

The bash while loop is a control flow statement that allows code or commands to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition.

A while loop is a statement that iterates over a block of code till the condition specified is evaluated to false. We can use this statement or loop in our program when do not know how many times the condition is going to evaluate to true before evaluating to false.  

The syntax of a while loop in BASH is something like below:

while [ condition ];
do
    # statements
    # commands
done  
If the condition is true then the commands inside the while block are executed and are iterated again after checking the condition. Also if the condition is false the statements inside the while block are skipped and the statements after the while block are executed.
